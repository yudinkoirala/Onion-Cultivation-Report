## INTRODUCTION  

This report documents the cultivation of onion (*Allium cepa*) variety N-52 under organic management.  
Onion is a widely grown and economically important vegetable crop.  
This trial evaluated a sustainable production method using organic fertilizers and integrated pest control to produce healthy bulbs.  

**Objectives**:  
- Detail the cultivation process.  
- Assess outcomes (plant growth, bulb size, yield potential).  
- Apply organic amendments (compost/FYM, biofertilizer).  
- Use non-chemical pest control, aligning with research on soil fertility and crop quality.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS  

- **Seed**: 250 g N-52 onion seeds.  
- **Pre-treatment**: Seeds soaked in clean water for 18 hours before sowing.  

### Nursery Beds
- **Size**: 1 m × 3 m (three beds).  
- **Mixture**: Soil:compost (1:1).  
- **Fertilizer per bed**: 250 g urea, 250 g DAP, 250 g potash.  
- **Sowing date**: 28 Mangsir (mid-December).  
- **Spacing**: Row 5 cm, plant 3 cm.  
- **Management**: Daily irrigation + straw mulch (removed after 1 month).  

### Main Field  
- **Beds**: 8 beds (1 m × 20 m × 15 cm raised).  
- **Amendments per bed**: FYM + 1 kg urea + 1 kg DAP + 1 kg potash + biofertilizer (Azospirillum, PSB).  
- **Spacing**: 25 cm between rows, 20 cm between plants (~200 plants per bed).  
- **Irrigation**: Drip lines, weekly irrigation (withheld 10 days before harvest).

## CULTIVATION PROCESS  

### Nursery Stage (Mangsir 28 – Poush 28)  
- Seeds sown in prepared beds.  
- Irrigated daily; straw mulch for 30 days.  
- Seedlings reached 15–20 cm by 28 Poush.  

### Transplanting (19 Magh)  
- Seedlings transplanted to field (4 rows × ~50 plants per bed).  
- Done early morning in moist soil.  
- Straw mulch reapplied + manual weeding every 2 weeks.  

### Pest and Disease Management  
- No chemical pesticides.  
- Yellow sticky traps used for thrips.  
- No major pest/disease observed.  

### Harvest (25 Chaitra)  
- Harvested when 70% foliage dried down.  
- Bulbs lifted and cured in field.  
- Yield: ~160 kg.

## RESULTS  

- ~800 plants transplanted.  
- Bulbs matured in ~60 days.  
- Bulb size: 8–12 cm diameter.  
- Healthy, uniform, no deformities.  
- Low weed pressure due to mulch + weeding.  
- No significant pest/disease issues.  
- Yield potential: high, with marketable quality bulbs.
